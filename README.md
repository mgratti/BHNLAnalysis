# BHNLAnalysis

This is a collection of scripts that were used to perform several analyses for the BHNL Analysis.

Each directory corresponds to a different topic; in each dir, you usually find a ".py" script, with a line of documentation at the beginning, and the related inputs/outputs.

All scripts, except those in [NOTEBOOKS](./NOTEBOOKS) run on top of 10_2_X.
